    "text": "Shane Curtis’ Website.\nWelcome! I’m Shane Curtis, a passionate student and entrepreneur currently pursuing a degree in Business Studies with a specialisation in Data Analytics at Dublin City University. Blending my analytical skills and entrepreneurial spirit, I’ve launched and successfully grown a vintage clothing business specialising in American collegiate apparel and vintage sportswear. Additionally, I’ve been deeply involved with Curtis & Dunne, my family’s owned menswear retail business known for exceptional customer service and community engagement.\nBeyond my entrepreneurial endeavours, I’m dedicated to continuous learning, recently diving into Python, cloud computing, and data visualization tools like Power BI. My approach combines rigorous analytics with creative problem-solving, helping businesses leverage data-driven strategies to boost performance and customer engagement.\nWhether it’s coding a new feature for my website, refining growth strategies for Curtis & Dunne, or exploring investment opportunities in emerging markets, I consistently seek new challenges. This website is not only a portfolio but also a reflection of my journey, ambitions, and commitment to innovation. Feel free to reach out—I’m always eager to collaborate, learn, and exchange ideas!"

In addition, I have personally overseen the social media aspect of the business and helped manage traffic flows for the e-commerce side. Curtis&Dunne has played a huge role in my development, and I continue to learn day in and day out from this family venture."

    "text": "Vintage Varsity\n\n\nVintage Varsity is my entrepreneurial venture, which I started in late 2023. As someone who has always been interested in starting my own business, I thought it would be a fun yet educational project to pursue. I created the logo, business name, and brand identity first. Following this, I sourced multiple suppliers from Cork and Dublin to Austria, where I obtain vintage American apparel such as university hoodies and sweatshirts, as well as American pro sports jerseys (NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL)."
