  StockPath is the idea that me and my friends cam up with for our college NED project. The idea came from my background in retail, as it is a stock management software solution. StockPath is a software business, built to help small business deal with the stock management issue that they face on a daily basis. We aim to create an app that pairs with a website, which will allow business owners to access valuable stock data insights at any time. We look to reduce the impacts of stock-takes too by implementing a "segmented stock-take" approach, to reduce the time consuming element of stock-takes. Click On The Image To Learn More!

Coding has been a passion of mine for a very long time, which is why when I had the chance to choose it has my final year specialisation i jumped at the chance. Along the way I have been a part of various coding projects and completed various difficult coding tasks, such as building this website or building a machine learning, classification model, built to predict company bankruptcy. In addition to this I have taken part in various Kubicle courses which have helped further my coding, data analytics and data visualisations skills. Click On The Image To Learn More!

For our "Business Strategy" module, me and my team chose Keogh's as the company we wanted to analyse and strategically review. We looked at all aspects of the crisp manufactorers, from their traditional farming roots, to their supply chain effficiency. As we inspected all aspects of the business we then gave recommendations on key strategic issues that we had highlighted along the way. We then presented our findings in presentation format for our class to review. Click On The Image To View The Report!
