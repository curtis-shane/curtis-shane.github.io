I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of business and technology, and I’m constantly exploring ways to blend my academic knowledge with real-world impact.\n\nOver the past few years, I’ve had the privilege of launching and growing my own vintage clothing business, focusing on authentic American collegiate apparel and vintage sportswear. From sourcing unique pieces to managing sales on Depop and attending in-person vintage markets, this venture has taught me the ins and outs of e-commerce, brand building, and customer experience. It's been a rewarding journey that reflects both my eye for style and my commitment to creating value in niche markets.\n\nAlongside this, I play a key role in Curtis & Dunne, my family’s independent menswear business based in a small Irish town. We’re proud of our reputation for exceptional customer service, quality brands, and genuine community engagement. My involvement spans everything from marketing and retail strategy to exploring the future of fashion retail in a digital age. This hands-on experience has given me a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing traditional businesses today.\n\nBeyond my entrepreneurial pursuits, I’m committed to lifelong learning and building a well-rounded skill set. I’ve recently immersed myself in Python programming, cloud computing, and data visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau. These tools allow me to turn raw data into meaningful insights—helping businesses make informed decisions, identify trends, and unlock new opportunities. I’m especially interested in using analytics to solve real-world problems and drive sustainable growth.\n\nI approach every project with a mix of curiosity, creativity, and strategic thinking. Whether I’m optimizing backend processes, refining a customer segmentation model, coding a new feature for this website, or developing marketing strategies for Curtis & Dunne, I thrive when I’m learning, building, and pushing boundaries. I’m also passionate about investing, particularly in emerging technologies and global markets, and I enjoy exploring how macroeconomic trends can shape new business landscapes.\n\nThis website is more than just a portfolio—it’s a living document of my journey so far. It captures my work, my interests, and my evolving perspective as a student, entrepreneur, and future data professional. I’m always open to new collaborations, interesting conversations, or simply exchanging ideas—so don’t hesitate to get in touch. Let’s connect, build, and grow together.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI’m Shane Curtis—a driven student, aspiring data analyst, and passionate entrepreneur currently pursuing a degree in Business Studies with a specialisation in Data Analytics at Dublin City University.
