  This is Curtis&Dunne, my family’s menswear clothing store based in the town of Drogheda. Since opening in 2020, Curtis&Dunne has built a community of loyal customers and fostered a strong local community spirit. In the five years I’ve worked at Curtis&Dunne, I have learned so much about the day-to-day running and management of a business. In addition, I have personally overseen the social media aspect of the business and helped manage traffic flows for the e-commerce side.

  Vintage Varsity is my entrepreneurial venture, which I started in late 2023. As someone who has always been interested in starting my own business, I thought it would be a fun yet educational project to pursue. I created the logo, business name, and brand identity first. Following this, I sourced multiple suppliers from Cork and Dublin to Austria, where I obtain vintage American apparel such as university hoodies and sweatshirts, as well as American pro sports jerseys (NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL).

I will be taking part in the Bennet Hospitality Internship in the summer of 2025, a fantastic transatlantic work opportunity. The internship was open to four students from the Business Studies final year class, and following three rounds of rigorous interviews, I was offered one of the four positions available this summer. I am excited to immerse myself in a real-world environment that promises both professional development and personal growth, while gaining valuable insights into the global hospitality industry. This internship is a fantastic opportunity that I eagerly look forward to taking part in.
