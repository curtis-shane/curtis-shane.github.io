On this page I highlight my coding and data analyitcs achievements. Through my three years at DCU I have participated in Data Analytics modules, and even specialised in the topic for my final year. Through these years I have created projects, such as this website or even created a machine learning algorithm, designed to identify bankrupt businesses. Along the way I have also collected certificates from Kubicle, across various data analytics topics from AI to Data Storage. Below are the links to my Machine Learning Algorithm and My Kubicle Certfications.
