    "text": "I’m Shane Curtis—a driven student, aspiring data analyst, and passionate entrepreneur currently pursuing a degree in Business Studies with a specialisation in Data Analytics at Dublin City University. I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of business and technology, and I’m constantly exploring ways to blend my academic knowledge with real-world impact.\nOver the past few years, I’ve had the privilege of launching and growing my own vintage clothing business, focusing on authentic American collegiate apparel and vintage sportswear. From sourcing unique pieces to managing sales on Depop and attending in-person vintage markets, this venture has taught me the ins and outs of e-commerce, brand building, and customer experience. It’s been a rewarding journey that reflects both my eye for style and my commitment to creating value in niche markets.\nAlongside this, I play a key role in Curtis & Dunne, my family’s independent menswear business based in a small Irish town. We’re proud of our reputation for exceptional customer service, quality brands, and genuine community engagement. My involvement spans everything from marketing and retail strategy to exploring the future of fashion retail in a digital age. This hands-on experience has given me a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing traditional businesses today.\nBeyond my entrepreneurial pursuits, I’m committed to lifelong learning and building a well-rounded skill set. I’ve recently immersed myself in Python programming, cloud computing, and data visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau. These tools allow me to turn raw data into meaningful insights—helping businesses make informed decisions, identify trends, and unlock new opportunities. I’m especially interested in using analytics to solve real-world problems and drive sustainable growth.\nI approach every project with a mix of curiosity, creativity, and strategic thinking. Whether I’m optimizing backend processes, refining a customer segmentation model, coding a new feature for this website, or developing marketing strategies for Curtis & Dunne, I thrive when I’m learning, building, and pushing boundaries. I’m also passionate about investing, particularly in emerging technologies and global markets, and I enjoy exploring how macroeconomic trends can shape new business landscapes.\nThis website is more than just a portfolio—it’s a living document of my journey so far. It captures my work, my interests, and my evolving perspective as a student, entrepreneur, and future data professional. I’m always open to new collaborations, interesting conversations, or simply exchanging ideas—so don’t hesitate to get in touch. Let’s connect, build, and grow together."

    "text": "The aim of this project is to build a robust and interpretable classification model that can effectively predict corporate bankruptcy using traditional financial indicators. This project follows a structured machine learning pipeline: from data exploration and pre-processing, to model selection, then training, and finally evaluation. Some key challenges addressed include high dimensionality, significant class imbalance, and the need for model transparency—especially when considering the critical implications of bankruptcy misclassification.\nCareful attention was given to choosing the right models for handling imbalanced binary classification, addressing differences in feature scales, and using performance metrics beyond accuracy to better evaluate how well the models could predict outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe dataset was sourced from Kaggle; it consists of 6,819 company records with 95 financial attributes and a clear binary target variable, “Bankrupt?”, which denotes whether a company had declared bankruptcy (1) or not (0). All features were continuous and complete, eliminating the need for missing value imputation.\nHowever, there was a challenge of extreme class imbalance: only 3.2% of instances represented bankrupt companies (220 out of 6,819). This imbalance is common in financial datasets and required targeted techniques to prevent models from becoming biased toward predicting the majority class.\n\n\n\nExploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand feature behavior, detect outliers, and identify relationships with the target variable. Visualizations of class distributions confirmed the imbalance, while correlation analysis highlighted features with strong discriminatory potential.\nFinancial metrics such as “Debt Ratio %,” “Current Liability to Assets,” and “Borrowing Dependency” were positively correlated with bankruptcy, indicating financial stress. On the other hand, profitability features like “ROA (A),” “Net Worth/Assets,” and “Net Income to Total Assets” were negatively correlated with bankruptcy.\nThese findings informed both model design and interpretation, highlighting variables with strong predictive value.\n\n\n\nFeature scaling was implemented using StandardScaler, which standardizes features to zero mean and unit variance. This step is crucial for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes, such as logistic regression, ensuring fair weight distribution across predictors.\nScaling was applied only after the train-test split, with the scaler fitted exclusively on the training data. This preserves the integrity of the test set and prevents data leakage.\n\n\n\nTo address the severe class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was introduced to the training set. SMOTE works by generating synthetic examples of the minority class by interpolating between existing observations (Chawla et al., 2002). This ensures a balanced class distribution without simply duplicating data.\nOversampling was strictly limited to the training set, preserving the original class proportions in the test set and ensuring proper generalization.\n\n\n\nFollowing pre-processing, three models were chosen: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These were selected for their interpretability and their suitability for imbalanced binary classification, offering a balance between simplicity, robustness, and interpretability.\n\nLogistic Regression: Chosen for its linear decision boundary and interpretability. It was enhanced to handle class imbalance by setting class_weight='balanced'.\nRandom Forest (Breiman, 2001): Selected for its robustness and ability to handle non-linear interactions among features. Feature bagging in Random Forest also reduces overfitting and offers interpretability through feature importance scores.\nXGBoost (Chen & Guestrin, 2016): Chosen for its scalability and high performance on structured data, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.\n\nAll models were trained using the balanced dataset (post-SMOTE) and evaluated beyond just accuracy—metrics like recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC were used to capture the ability to correctly identify bankrupt companies.\n\n\n\nInitially, each model was trained with default hyperparameters to establish baseline performance. Then, hyperparameter tuning was performed, particularly for Random Forest, to optimize parameters such as tree depth, number of estimators, and minimum samples per split.\nGridSearchCV with 5-fold cross validation was used to systematically search parameter combinations, focusing on maximizing the ROC AUC score. For instance:\n\nn_estimators: [100, 200, 300]\nmax_depth: [None, 10, 20, 30]\nmin_samples_split: [2, 5, 10]\n\nLogistic Regression and XGBoost were adjusted manually (e.g., max_iter=1000 for Logistic Regression to ensure convergence and eval_metric='logloss' for XGBoost). This training approach ensured all models were exposed to the same balanced data and fairly evaluated.\n\n\n\nMultiple evaluation metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC—were used to fully capture performance. Considering the real-world costs of missing bankruptcies, greater emphasis was placed on recall and ROC AUC. Some experiments involved lowering the classification threshold (e.g., to 0.3 in Logistic Regression) to increase recall, acknowledging that in cost-sensitive situations, false negatives can be more damaging than false positives.\nConfusion matrices and precision-recall curves were also used to analyze model misclassification patterns, especially important in highly imbalanced datasets (Saito and Rehmsmeier, 2015)."

    "text": "Initially, each model was trained with default hyperparameters to establish baseline performance. Then, hyperparameter tuning was performed, particularly for Random Forest, to optimize parameters such as tree depth, number of estimators, and minimum samples per split.\nGridSearchCV with 5-fold cross validation was used to systematically search parameter combinations, focusing on maximizing the ROC AUC score. For instance:\n\nn_estimators: [100, 200, 300]\nmax_depth: [None, 10, 20, 30]\nmin_samples_split: [2, 5, 10]\n\nLogistic Regression and XGBoost were adjusted manually (e.g., max_iter=1000 for Logistic Regression to ensure convergence and eval_metric='logloss' for XGBoost). This training approach ensured all models were exposed to the same balanced data and fairly evaluated."

    "text": "Multiple evaluation metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC—were used to fully capture performance. Considering the real-world costs of missing bankruptcies, greater emphasis was placed on recall and ROC AUC. Some experiments involved lowering the classification threshold (e.g., to 0.3 in Logistic Regression) to increase recall, acknowledging that in cost-sensitive situations, false negatives can be more damaging than false positives.\nConfusion matrices and precision-recall curves were also used to analyze model misclassification patterns, especially important in highly imbalanced datasets (Saito and Rehmsmeier, 2015)."
