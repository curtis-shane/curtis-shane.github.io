I’m [Your Name], a passionate student and entrepreneur currently pursuing a degree in Business Studies with a specialisation in Data Analytics at Dublin City University. Blending my analytical skills and entrepreneurial spirit, I’ve launched and successfully grown a vintage clothing business specialising in American collegiate apparel and vintage sportswear. Additionally, I’ve been deeply involved with Curtis & Dunne, my family’s owned menswear retail business known for exceptional customer service and community engagement.\nBeyond my entrepreneurial endeavours, I’m dedicated to continuous learning, recently diving into Python, cloud computing, and data visualization tools like Power BI. My approach combines rigorous analytics with creative problem-solving, helping businesses leverage data-driven strategies to boost performance and customer engagement.\nWhether it’s coding a new feature for my website, refining growth strategies for Curtis & Dunne, or exploring investment opportunities in emerging markets, I consistently seek new challenges. This website is not only a portfolio but also a reflection of my journey, ambitions, and commitment to innovation. Feel free to reach out—I’m always eager to collaborate, learn, and exchange ideas!"
